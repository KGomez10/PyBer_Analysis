# PyBer_Analysis
Chapter 5 challenge PyBer_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this new analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, show the total weekly fares for each city type and provide data that differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

# Results:
As per the analysis provided, the Urban cities have a larger number of rides which provides a higher number of total fares.

By reviewing the dataframe above, the total numbers for "Urban" cities is shown as the highest when it comes to Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares. However, the average fare ride cost for the "Urban" cities is reflected as the lowest as well as the average fare per driver. 

The highest fare per rides cost is for the "Rural" cities at a whooping $36.62 and an avverage fare per driver amount of $55.48. Yet as per the data collected, the total amount of drivers is way lesser than the other cities.

# Summary: 

Based on the results, please view the following recommendations:

1. Highering more drivers for both Suburban and Rural cities will help bring in more business as well as more funds to both cities.

2. Rural cities have the highest cost in rides therefore highering more drivers will expand more job opportinities and bring in expansion opportiny.


3. Urban cities bring in the most funds but only because they have the most drivers. Possibly highering the amount per ride and can bring even more funds, brining in even more job opportunities.
